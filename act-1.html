      data-story="🏰 The Legend of the Knight of Winterfell||Prologue: The Shadow over the Spire||The Kingdom of Winterfell was a land of eternal spring and golden light — until the blood-moon rose.||From the jagged peaks of the Shadow Realm, Count **Dracula** descended in a whirlwind of bats, breaching the palace gardens and snatching **Princess Elara**.||Desperate and broken, the King issued a Royal Proclamation:||&quot;To any man who returns my daughter safely, I grant her hand in marriage, half the kingdom's treasury, and a seat at the Round Table. Your name shall be etched in stone for eternity.&quot;||While the veteran knights hesitated, fearing the vampire's curse, a young Squire-in-training gripped his rusted iron sword. He had no titles and no land, only a heart full of courage and a name he was determined to make honorable.||━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━||⚔️ Act I: The Morning of Trials||Setting: The Sun-Drenched Outskirts of Winterfell.||The journey begins at dawn. The Squire sets out through the rolling hills, but the path is already crawling with Dracula's scouts — lowly **Slimes** and forest **Goblins** meant to deter the weak.||The Squire is unseasoned. He must use his **Sword** to cut through the monsters, absorbing their essence to gain the Experience needed to survive the trek.||He must navigate treacherous pits and moving platforms, proving his agility. As the sun reaches its peak, he finds a discarded Royal Longbow near a fallen scout — a weapon he will need for the perils ahead."
